### Workshops & Seminar Series

The Computational Cameras Group at Caltech is committed to organizing events that  bring together  researchers  from  different  fields to share ideas. Prof. Bouman has co-organized the International Conference on Computational Photography (2022), [Computational Cameras and Displays Workshop at CVPR (2019 & 2020)](http://ccd2020.cms.caltech.edu/), a [Keck Institute for Space Studies Workshop](https://kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/black_hole/black_hole.html) (2019-2021), the [SPACE West Webinar Series](https://sites.google.com/view/sps-space), among others. The Computational Cameras group is particularly excited to be

* Co-organizer of the [Grundfest Lecture Series](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/web_series/). The Grundfest Lecture series highlights rising stars in computational imaging. The series is co-organized by UCLA and Caltech and is held the first Friday of every month. Inspired by the hardships junior researchers face during COVID-19,  the lecture includes an “inverse-honorarium”: a monetary award for junior candidates with a non-permanent academic position (e.g. PhD student, postdoc). 


### Mentoring Undergraduate Students

The computational cameras group mentors undergraduate students in summer research opportunities through Caltech's [Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)](https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf) and [WAVE Fellowship](https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/wavefellows) programs. These programs match undergraduates recruited from around the country with a faculty member and graduate student mentor, who introduce them to research tools used in cutting edge science, engineering, and technology. The WAVE program focuses on students from underrepresented minorities. *For undergraduate students interested in working in our group over the summer:* please see the links above for information on how to apply. 

Prof. Bouman also teaches a Machine Learning Projects course at Caltech. The goal of the course is to connect undergraduates with mentors in both CS/EE and a particular domain in order to work on a 10-week project in small groups. These projects are meant to engage and inspire undergraduate students to pursue interdisciplinary research as well as give them personal connections to faculty.

The members of the computational camera’s group also participate on mentoring panels, such as the ones focused on helping undergraduates prepare and apply for graduate school.
