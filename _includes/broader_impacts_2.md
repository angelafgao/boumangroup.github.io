The Computational Cameras Group’s primary goal of public outreach is to introduce students to STEM and show them how exciting projects in STEM are. Being part of the team who captured the first image of a black hole, our group has been incredibly fortunate to participate in a project that sparks public interest.  At these events, in addition to explaining the work scientifically, our goal is to also discuss how we’ve gotten interested in engineering, what it’s like working on collaborative projects, and challenges we’ve each encountered along the way. Events that Prof. Bouman has participated in include

* Given talks and participated in Q&A panels at over 60 different venues, with an emphasis on Q&A panels with young students, women, and underrepresented minority (URM) groups at different schools and conferences
* Given talks at public outreach events such as [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_bouman_how_to_take_a_picture_of_a_black_hole), the Boston Science Museum, local middle and high schools, and local observatories
* [Testified in Congress](https://www.c-span.org/video/?460697-1/astrophysicists-astronomers-testify-event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-imagery) to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology about the important role of young researchers in Big Science, and the need to “spark” interest in STEM at a young age. 
* Outreach articles, such as one that appeared on the front cover of [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-inside-story-of-the-first-picture-of-a-black-hole) and [Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/a/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-programmers/)
* Participated in outreach videos on the importance of computational imaging for the IEEE signal processing society


Prof. Bouman was honored to receive an AAAS Early Career Award for Public Engagement for her efforts in public outreach. She is inspired everyday by the stories of young students from around the world that are excited by science and engineering! 


### Diversity and Inclusion

The Computational Cameras Group at Caltech is dedicated to the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are a community that values and celebrates differences among our members and we strive to create an equitable and inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds.

Prof. Bouman and group member Angela Gao are also currently members of the Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) steering committee, with the goal of helping to evaluate and improve the environment at Caltech for a diverse student body.
